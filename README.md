Project 3: Telemedicine system for remote residents:

There are many remote residents who have difficulty getting
medication from Regional Hospitals. The hospital needs a system to take
care of these remote residents.
- A remote resident can register this system and upload her/his health information.
- The system can automatically upload real time health information obtained from
sensors or other medical devices when the remote resident uses this system.
- By permission, a doctor can access residents' health information.
- The doctor can give instructions about medicare to the remote resident through the
system.
- In case the remote resident needs emergency care, the system alarm the hospital
immediately.
- The system will keep the privacy and security for all the medical information.
